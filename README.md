# zkapp-Merkle
"Merkle Map" zero-knowledge example
To summarize the project:

    ZK-Apps: A type of application that uses ZK-SNARKs (zero-knowledge proofs) to improve privacy and security.
    Merkle Trees: A data structure used to validate and store data.

Project Function:

    Using Merkle trees with ZK-Apps, allowing users to perform operations such as verification and authentication while keeping their data private.

Benefits of the Project:

    Privacy: Users' data is hidden by ZK-SNARKs.
    Security: Merkle trees ensure that data is protected against forgery.
    Verification: The accuracy of the data can be verified by ZK-SNARKs.
    Efficiency: Merkle trees enable efficient storage and verification of data.
